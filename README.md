# ScoreKeeper

This is my first web development project â€” a simple **Score Keeper** app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It allows two players to keep track of their scores and displays a winner once a target score is reached.

It's a beginner-friendly project to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic frontend logic.
